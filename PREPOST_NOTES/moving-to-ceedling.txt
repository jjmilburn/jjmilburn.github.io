*have to install avr-gcc, was not brought in with ceedling (blinky proj)

1) install rvm-ruby to manage the ceedling package
     * https://rvm.io/rvm/install
     * \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
     * source /home/josh/.rvm/scripts/rvm
     * gem install ceedling

2) Create a 'ceedling-tests' directory in the project directory
    * Open the 'project.yml' file, and add your existing file paths to the
    'source' section
    * Keep the 'support' section as-is
    * Keep the 'test' section as-is

Test All The Things!
How can we write tests for our code which calls hardware-specific interfaces?
Cmock - works well, easy button (‘ceedling’ integration)
Super automatic!
Also.. potentially brittle.  Default case is ‘if you call it in the
Code and don’t mock it in the test code, it will fail!’
FFF [Fake Function Framework] 
Does not assume you have 

* Architecturally, to build effective tests, the API to your modules must
allow you to construct something meaningful to interact with -- without this,
there is little ability to test.

Things to do:
* Ensure clang scan-build is still running over the build
