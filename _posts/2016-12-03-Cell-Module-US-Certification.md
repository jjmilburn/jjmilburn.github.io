title: The Basics - Certifying a Cellular Product in the US
---

Even if your nifty new GSM module has an FCC certification, it doesn't mean
the integrated product is fine to sell on the open market.  This post pulls
together estimates from various sources to gain a rough estimate of total cost
for RF-related certification on a product using a pre-certified cellular
module.

First, lets be clear -- I'm not a legal expert on cellular certifications, and
the information in this post is meant to be informative, not a complete guide
to what you need to cerify a GSM product in the US.  With that in mind, lets
proceed...

### Untitled Header Section

If you intend to sell a product with radio communication in the EU, [R&TTE](http://www.tuv.com/en/usa/services_usa/product_testing/telecom_it/rtte_directive/rtte_directive.html) compliance will likely be required.  GSM/M2M modules can be [individually certified as compliant with R&TTE](http://www.tuv-sud.co.uk/uploads/images/1365171464129234960088/uk-mkg-guide-to-wireless-m2m-module-integration-en-uk.pdf), which reduces the testing burden.  A number of third party test facilities (TUV, 7-Layers, IB Lenhardt, etc.) exist which can help take a product through the R&TTE certification process.

### PTCRB

This was mentioned briefly in a previous post, but you can't ignore this agency
if planning to sell in the USA.  As mentioned previously, the cost for this
certification runs between [$16k-20k for a data-only device](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/ptcrb-process-costs-timeline-and-labs/).
