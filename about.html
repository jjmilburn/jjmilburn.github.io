  <h2>About the site</h2>
  <p>A place to put (mostly technical) discoveries that come up in the course
  of my work.  Likely something of interest to those designing cost-efficient
  hardware for monitoring and control and M2M applications (or, if you're
  enamored of publicity and fancy names for old concepts, "IoT").</p>
