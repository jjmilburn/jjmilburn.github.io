# About

Josh Milburn is a [professional engineer](https://search.dca.ca.gov/details/7500/E/21831/0d5da92c0ab25c45f27e614c2ca54565)
working on energy access problems with [Angaza](http://www.angaza.com).
He enjoys the technical challenges of embedded development and
mixed-signal design, and finds working with a distributed
team to accomplish high-impact development goals very satisfying.

This site is where I'll put (mostly technical) discoveries that come up during
the course of my work.  You might find something of interest if remotely
located embedded systems for M2M monitoring and control applications is of
interest (or, if you're enamored of publicity and fancy names for old concepts,
'IoT').
